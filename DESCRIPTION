Description: This package provides functions for identification and 
  visualization of potential intramolecular triplex patterns in DNA sequence.
  The main functionality is to detect the positions of subsequences capable of 
  folding into an intramolecular triplex (H-DNA) in a much larger sequence. 
  The potential H-DNA (triplexes) should be made of as many cannonical 
  nucleotide triplets as possible. The package includes visualization showing 
  the exact base-pairing in 1D, 2D or 3D.
