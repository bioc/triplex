CHANGES IN VERSION 1.0.0
-------------------------

BUG FIXES

    o Fixed P-value definition

    o Fixed splitting sequence into smaller computational pieces. The end
      of larger sequences was not searched properly.

    o Fixed handling of special IUPAC symbols (R, M, W, D, etc.). These are
      now cut off as N and - symbols.

    o Fixed scoring matrices for matches and geometrical compatibility. They
      were combined with wrong types of triplexes. Among other things this
      caused the output of the program to be slightly innaccurate for certain
      types of triplexes.
